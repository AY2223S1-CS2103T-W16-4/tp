--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `addClient n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `NAME` and `PHONE_NUMBER` are parameters which can be used as `addClient n/John Tan p/12345678`.

* Items in square brackets are optional, while those not in square brackets are compulsory.<br>
  e.g. `addClient` can be used as `addClient n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER [e/EMAIL] [b/BIRTHDAY]` for example `addClient n/John p/12345678 e/John@abc.com b/12122000` or `addClient n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER` for example `addClient n/John Tan p/12345678`.<br>

* This symbol `||` indicates that only one of the optional parameters can be used. Using more than one optional parameter is strictly not allowed.
  e.g. `listClient` can be used as either `listClient pd/[PRODUCT]` for example `listClient pd/Product1` or `listClient bd/BIRTHDAY` for example `listClient bd/week`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `d/28092022 d/30092022`, only `d/30092022` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `exit` and `help`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `exit 123`, it will be interpreted as `exit`.
