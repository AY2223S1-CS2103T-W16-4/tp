### Project: MyInsuRec

*MyInsuRec* is a desktop app for financial advisors to manage and organize their clients and meetings, helping
financial advisors stay connected with their clients. *MyInsuRec* is best suited for the quick typist, as it is
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), with all the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view a client's details
  * What it does: Users can view more details regarding the client such as the client's birthday and meetings associated with the client instead of just an overview.
  * Justification: It is a core feature for financial advisors to manage their contacts and record down clients' particulars.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view a meeting's details
  * What it does: Users can view more details regarding the meeting such as the meeting's schedule and the client's details whom the user is meeting with.
  * Justification: It is a core feature for financial advisors to help plan their schedules and better prepare for the meeting.

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Added the ability for users to tag a product to a client
  * Justification: It helps the financial advisor record down the products which the client has bought. It aims to improve the user's experience so that the user can have more information about the client.

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Added the ability for users to filter clients based on the products they bought
  * Justification: Financial advisors can now have an overview of the clients who bought a specific type of product. If a product's policy has changed, the financial advisor can immediately know who is affected. Furthermore, it also helps the financial advisor to perform analysis on which product is the most popular.

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Added the ability for user to specify the ending time for a meeting
  * Justification: Financial advisors can specify the **exact** duration for the meeting to ensure that meetings won't be overlapping. Previously we didn't have an ending time which is problematic because the financial advisor can enter 2 meetings that are 1 minute away from each other which doesn't make sense in the real life situation.

* **Project management**:
  * Assigned tasks and bugs to group members to ensure that project's objectives are met
  * Performed smoke testing before each release and reported bugs when necessary

* **Tests**:
  * Wrote extensive test cases for `addClient` command, `addMeeting` command, `viewClient` command, `AddClientCommandParser`, `NoConflictMeetingList` and `Meeting`

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for `listClient`, `addProduct`, `viewClient`, `viewMeeting`: [#196](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/pull/196), [#284](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/pull/284)
    * Added hyperlinks to improve navigability: [#203](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/pull/203)
